# Technical Indicators

Technical indicators as you might already know, are pattern-based signals produced by mathematical calculations based on historic price, volume, or open interest information. Although some indicators are very simple, they are still used by traders to analyse and forecast market movements.   

### What's there in this repo?  

Different technical indicators that were coded by the sophomores of QuantClub using the `BackTrader` package in `Python`. The strategies were also back-tested on historical data of both Indian and international stocks.    

### Where to find the indicator codes?   

The codes of each person are organized under separate folders. Indicator codes can be found in the folder named `src` under each person's folder.    

Also, `.ipynb` notebooks containing the visualizations can be found under each person's folder.  

### Pre-requisites
